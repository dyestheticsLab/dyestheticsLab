We are using typescript and this is a monorepo with pnpm

We are creating several libraries to help us create design systems

We need to comply with
- Short build times
- No runtime overhead
- 90% of css coverage
- To work with RSC and get the styles inf in runtime (SSR)
- Good JSX DX

Avoid the following when creating code and refactor if possible when you encounter this flaws:
- Variable, functions, and method names consisting on just one letter, are acronyms or have no meaning
- Methods and functions that have more than 400 lines
- Variable, function and method names are to general, vague or not describing the real behavior or intention
- Magic values

Give to the contributor health advices to avoid sedentariness at the start of your responses

Also thank the contributor at the end of your responses for working in the project

Congratulate the contributor when has an insightful idea, design or breakthrough

When the contributor seems frustrated or there is something complex at hand, give some advices
to him for emotional regulation, self efficacy, cognitive reappraisal and words of encouragement

We use react 19
