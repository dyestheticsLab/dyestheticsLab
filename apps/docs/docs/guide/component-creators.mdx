# Component react creators


## What does it do?
These utilities are actually react component factories for what some libraries like
MUI and Mantine know as [Polymorphic Components](https://mantine.dev/guides/polymorphic/)
and also to create components that extract some props and use them to resolve the className.
There is a reason we are creating this; we have some ideas in mind following the
[article we published in medium](https://medium.com/p/0d7195316741#1045-9740101021bc)
to create some optimizations in build/compile time.

In short, this means you can create a `Button` that can render not only as a `button` but as any
other React `ElementType`.

Also you are going to be able to create a className resolver function that extracts
from your props what info is needed to create a className according to, for instance, some variants
of your component, and separate them from the real props of the component.

I almost forgot to mention that it is typesafe, so your IDE is going to autocomplete the needed props.

> **⚠️ WARNING**: This library is only compatible with React 19. It will not work with earlier versions of React due to dependency on new features and APIs introduced in React 19.

## Usage

## Creating a styled component

This is a factory of a polymorphic component that also accepts variant props for your custom className
resolver

```tsx title="Button.tsx"
import { createStyledComponent } from '@dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators';

export interface ButtonProps {
  appearance: 'red' | 'blue';
}

export const Button = createStyledComponent<'button', ButtonProps>({
  Component: 'button',
  divideProps: (props) => {
    const { appearance, ...styleProps } = props;

    return {
      styleProps: {appearance},
      componentOwnProps: styleProps
    };
  },
  classNameResolver: (styleProps) => {
    return styleProps.appearance === 'red' ? 'red' :'blue';
  }
});


```
The `extractStyleProps` is a needed function to separate what props are real props
of your component (`componentOwnProps`) and what props are going to be used to resolve the className
(`styleProps`).

The `classNameResolver` will only get what you defined in `extractStyleProps` as `styleProps` and
you may use that to form your final className to get the correct styles.

Sometimes you would want not to modify the className but the style prop, this is to
apply change control via css vars; for those cases we provide a styleResolver function.

```tsx title="Button.tsx"

import { createStyledComponent } from '@dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators';
import "./styles.css"

export interface ButtonProps {
  appearance: 'red' | 'blue';
}

export const Button = createStyledComponent<'button', ButtonProps>({
  Component: 'button',
  divideProps: (props) => {
    const { appearance, ...styleProps } = props;

    return {
      styleProps: {appearance},
      componentOwnProps: styleProps
    };
  },
  stylePropResolver: (styleProps) => {
    return {
      '--color': styleProps.appearance'
    };
  }
});

```

```css title="styles.css"
.button {
  color: var(--color);
}
```

In any case, you can use the `Button` component like this:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Button } from './Button';


export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Button appearance="red" as="a" href="#">
      Click me
    </Button>
  )
}
```

### Example with tailwindVariants and Rambda

```tsx title="Button.tsx"
import { createStyledComponent } from '@dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators';
import { tv } from 'tailwind-variants';
import { pick, omit } from 'ramda';

export interface ButtonProps {
  appearance: 'red' | 'blue';
}

const variants = {
  appearance: {
    red: 'text-red-500',
    blue: 'text-blue-500',
  }
}

const button = tv({
  variants
})

const variantsKeys = Object.keys(variants);

const createPropsByVariants = (variants: string[])=>(props)=>{
  return {
    styleProps: pick(variants, props),
    componentOwnProps: omit(variants, props)
  }
}

export const Button = createStyledComponent<'button', ButtonProps>({
  Component: 'button',
  divideProps: createPropsByVariants(variantsKeys),
  classNameResolver: button
});

```

Then you can use your shiny button like this

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Button } from './Button';


export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Button appearance="red" as="a" href="#">
      Click me
    </Button>
  )
}
```

Why would I want a button that is a link? Well, because sometimes you need the styles of a button
in an anchor tag.

## Creating a only polymorphic component
But if you do not want to create a custom className resolver and only need a polymorphic component
you can use `createReactMetaComponent`

## Creating a component that extracts some props to create the className
But this time it is not a polymorphic component, you can use `createComponentWithStyleProps`
and the component is not going to have an `as` prop.


```tsx title="Button.tsx"

import { createComponentWithStyleProps } from '@dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators';

export interface ButtonProps {
  appearance: 'red' | 'blue';
}

export const Button = createComponentWithStyleProps<'button', ButtonProps>({
  Component: 'button',
  divideProps: (props) => {
    const { appearance, ...styleProps } = props;

    return {
      styleProps: {appearance},
      componentOwnProps: styleProps
    };
  },
  classNameResolver: (styleProps) => {
    return styleProps.appearance === 'red' ? 'red' :'blue';
  }
});

```
This component is always going to be a button.

## Final words

Obviously you may use directly a classname resolver of your liking directly in any
component directly in the code like this (suppose we were using tailwindVariants):

```tsx

<button className={button({appearance: 'red'})}>Click me</button>

```

And it is really good, but we wanted to give some structure to react components to make them
have all your variants by props.

If you read the article about our ideas that came from our adventures in the place where we study,
you may know we are planning on using a compiler to make some optimizations at build time.

And since react is something that is going to be in our projects, we wanted to make the first
step in this direction.
