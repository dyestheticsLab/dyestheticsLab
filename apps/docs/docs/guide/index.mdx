# Introduction

We are creating several libraries to help us create design systems specially for
React.js. It is going to be a long road ahead of us.

This idea was born when in a university project we were asked to complain
to several constraints because we asked for a challenge.

By now we know that there are out there magnificent tools that are evolving
fast and offer a really good DX, decent performance and portability but they
did not covered 100% of what we were asked for, like:

- Short build times
- No runtime overhead
- 90% of css coverage
- To work with RSC and get the styles inf in runtime (SSR)
- Good JSX DX

## Projects that inspire us

While searching for some tools to help us with our project we found
some really good libraries that we used as inspiration or even
we build our tools around them, we really thank the open source community
for your incredible work:

- [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
- [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/)
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)
- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/)


## Some context...
For instance, we wanted to use some css variant generator, because you actually
do not know what variants you are going to need in compile time, all
the classes representing possible states of that variant were generated
and the coverage of used css was not accepted by our mentors.

Then we came upon [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/),
which was wonderful because it offered optimizations reading the jsx
and extracting the variants and creating a css file with only the classes
that were used. We love Tamagui.

But then, we needed to use the components as RSC and also the styles
were not known for those RSC ahead of time, since we were fetching that
info from a remote data source (we were doing SSR).

And the heuristics to know how to compile a component were going to be
lost since we do not know which variant value to apply till we are on runtime.

That is why we are building some tolls to help us build up, with luck, a complete
framework that can address all the constraints we are facing.

In that context we actually do not aspire to be a replacement of those
very powerful libraries, we are just experimenting with some ideas


## The road ahead
As for now we are building a library of react component creators and
around that a tailwind wrapper using tailwind variants (we love tailwind variants)

To make up for the missing responsive variants we are creating a babel loader
and a vite plugin to create the responsive variants in compile time (all of them).

As for the next steps we are looking to create a SWC plugin to
extract only the needed classes from from JSX syntax and transform them in
optimized components with only the needed tailwind classes.

Still the component creator will help us in dev mode meanwhile we are learning
enough rust to create the plugin.

As for the the RSC that hav a data source in runtime, we want to create a
set of NEXt.js utilities to help us register the needed classes when building in
SSG mode and use that resolved values to create only the needed classes in CSS file
and also to inline the critical CSS.

We know that for client components it is kind of different so we are thinking in
some way to extract the classes that are going to be passed to the client component
from the server component, kind of a proxy.

This approaches will need a strong set of rules and conventions the we need to
effectively communicate towards warnings and linter rules.

As you can see there is a lot of work to do and we are just starting.

## What we have so far

We have several packages but the three most usable are:

** @dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators **
This is our base to create polymorphic components with styles and variants

- @dyesthetics-lab/react-tv-variants-creators
This is a wrapper around tailwind variants and @dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators
to create responsive variants, but be careful, this does not work alone

- @dyesthetics-lab/tailwind-manifest-creators
To effectively create the responsive variants we need to create a manifest
with all the responsive variants to make tailwindcss read it to generate the
needed CSS, In this module we have loaders and plugins to helps us do so.
(We are planning to offer you a codegen cli also to give you an alternative to
this package)

You can test out our following libraries
- @dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators
- @dyesthetics-lab/react-tv-variants-creators
- @dyesthetics-lab/tailwind-utils
- @dyesthetics-lab/tailwind-manifest-creators
- @dyesthetics-lab/tailwind-utils

## Can I help out?
Of course! We are looking for contributors to help us out with the project. We
want to learn, but this days we are really busy with the university so be patient
with if you do not have an answer right away, nevertheless any pr from a fork is going
to be reviewed in the same week you it is sent.

## Final words
We are here to learn, we really appreciate any feedback you can give us.

Also we have an [article](https://medium.com/@shadowrunner8095/my-deep-dive-road-creating-a-design-system-component-library-with-tailwind-part-1-0d7195316741)
that ignited the idea of this project, bu created the libraries in the spur
of the moment right after the article was published.
