# Do you need a state manager for that DATA?
You may not need a state manager for some type fo data. But before diving
into it some words of caution.


## Words of caution :)

Don't get me wrong—state managers are incredibly powerful, and I love them.
This article isn't about telling you to rip Redux, Zustand, or Jotai out of your codebase.
In many cases, they are essential for managing state that multiple components subscribe to,
ensuring they update when the state changes.

But here's the thing: not all data in your app needs that kind of management. Some state
can be handled differently, without introducing unnecessary complexity or
performance overhead.


*State Managers Are Not an All-or-Nothing Decision*

This isn't a “pick one and stick with it” scenario. State managers and
alternative approaches can coexist in your app.

Some data fits naturally in a global store, while other pieces
of state can be handled more efficiently without one.

It all depends on how and where the data is used.

We are going to use TanStack Router for the example, but the same applies to other
routing libraries provided they have the features to support it.

## A simple example
I'm going to present a simple example for the sake of explanation.
Imagine we have an input field where a user enters some data.
Once the input is provided and validated, the form (using React 19 form actions on the client side)
is submitted. The action function then sends a request to the backend
with the input data, and if the response is successful, we navigate
the user to another page.

The important part is that we need data from the response on the
second page either to display it visually or to
process it before showing something to the user.

Using TanStack Router, you can pass that data via search
parameters using the navigation function from useNavigate.

(This is a simplified example,
and in a real-world scenario, you would likely
have more complex data structures and error handling.)

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from '@tanstack/react-router';

function Form(){
  const navigate = MyFirstRoute.useNavigate();
  const action = async ()=>{
    const { data, someOtherData } = await someMadeUpRequest();

    //some response processing

    await navigate({
      to: '/next-page',
      search: {
        data: data,
        otherData: otherData,
      },
    })
  }

  return <form action={action}>
    {/* form fields */}
  </form>

}
```

And now we can get the response data that is *only needed in the second page*
with the `useSearch` hook

```tsx
import { useSearch } from '@tanstack/react-router';


function NextPage(){
  const { data, otherData } = MySecondRoute.useSearch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Next Page</h1>
      <p>Data: {data}</p>
      <p>Other Data: {otherData}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```


But what if you don't want to expose the data in the URL as search params?
Because if you use navigate with the search params, it will be visible in the URL.

In that case, you can mask those parameters. TanStack Router supports this approach
by maintaining temporary location state internally.

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from '@tanstack/react-router';
function Form(){
  const navigate = MyFirstRoute.useNavigate();
  const action = async ()=>{
    const { data, someOtherData } = await someMadeUpRequest();

    //some response processing

    await navigate({
      to: '/next-page',
      state: {
        data: data,
        otherData: otherData,
      },
      mask: {
        to: '/next-page',
        // because here are not listed the search params, they will
        // not be visible in the URL
        // but they will be available with useSearch or in the loaders
      }
    })
  }

  return <form action={action}>
    {/* form fields */}
  </form>
}

```

This  data, can be used as well in your destination route loaders, there you have the opportunity
to perform any required operations before rendering.


Again, this approach isn't for every case. Consider a scenario where you have
a component, say, a button—and one or more components that aren't its
direct children need to update visually when that button is clicked. In this
scenario, we're dealing with an app state, that is, state internal to your application
that isn't fetched from an external system. Here, it makes sense to use a state manager.


And what about React Query? It features a powerful caching mechanism. If you obtain
a result in one mutation or query, you can retrieve the data response
and even the params that were used for the request from its cache
elsewhere in your app when needed. (There's a great
[article](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-query-as-a-state-manager) on this
topic by TkDodo that explains it in more detail.)

The key is to think carefully about how the data is going to be used.
Some developers prefer to centralize everything in one store for
predictability. While that creates a consistent pattern, making
it easy for AI tools and new developers to follow, it can also
lead to workarounds and unnecessary re-renders.

The argument for centralization is based on having one predictable pattern;
however, this can sometimes create secondary issues.

I believe that better documentation, like a flow diagram outlining different scenarios,
could help clarify when to use a state manager versus alternative approaches. Perhaps even an abstraction that handles data storage based on declared usage, or heuristics that decide the best storage method, could be beneficial. It’s a bit of a stretch, but it’s an idea that popped into my head while writing this.

What do you think? Do you have examples where the data doesn't need to be
stored in a state manager? Let's discuss!
