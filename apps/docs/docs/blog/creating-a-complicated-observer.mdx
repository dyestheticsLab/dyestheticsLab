Today I need to learn how to use Zustand. However, before I even started, I
told myself, "Wait a minute—let's complicate my life for a few minutes to see
how far I can get."

First of all, you must already understand how **useSyncExternalStore** works
before diving into what I'm doing.

So what I'm going to do is create an observer creator, because—as you
know—**useSyncExternalStore** requires two things: a function that subscribes
it to an external store and a snapshot function. The subscription function is
meant to tell the observer to save a function to be executed later, which then
calls the snapshot function. When the snapshot function runs, it compares the
previous value with the new snapshot result to decide whether or not to
trigger a re-render.

Here's what the code might look like:

```tsx
const createObserver = <T>({ initialState }: { initialState: T }) => {
  let state = initialState;
  const listeners = new Set<() => void>();

  const dispatch = () => {
    listeners.forEach((listener) => listener());
  };

  return {
    getState: (pickerFn?: (state: T) => any) =>
      pickerFn ? pickerFn(state) : state,
    setState: (newStateOrSetter: T | ((prevState: T) => T)) => {
      if (typeof newStateOrSetter === 'function')
        state = newStateOrSetter(state);
      else state = newStateOrSetter;

      dispatch();
    },
    subscribe: (listener: () => void) => {
      listeners.add(listener);
      return () => {
        listeners.delete(listener);
      };
    },
  };
};
```

The state is kept inside the closure, and the getState function accepts a
picker function so that if you pass a big object, you aren't forcing all
subscribers to re-render every time—it's better to pick only the part of the
object you need to compare.

Nice and done. Now, the problem with this approach is that if you create this
at the top level, you're creating a singleton—even if you need it for just one
page (I'm talking about CSR). So how do you scope it to a single page and then
let it disappear?

Well, we can use React Context. But before doing that, I'll create two hooks
to simplify usage. They look anemic (a tech term, like in anemic classes)
actually, but here they are anyway:

```tsx
const useCallbackSubscribe = (ObservableContext, pickerFn) => {
  const { getState, subscribe } = useContext(ObservableContext);
  const cb = useCallback(() => getState(pickerFn), [pickerFn, getState]);
  return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, cb);
};

// An optional, not optimized version just in case:
const useSubscribe = (ObservableContext, pickerFn) => {
  const { getState, subscribe } = useContext(ObservableContext);
  return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, () => getState(pickerFn));
};

const useNotify = (ObservableContext) => {
  const { setState } = useContext(ObservableContext);
  return setState;
};
```

Now what follows is the creation of the context. Isn't that a singleton as
well? Yes—maybe this will prove useful later when I want to ensure that this
is client-side only or for similar scenarios. Let's continue:

```tsx
export const IsActiveListenerContext = createContext<
  ReturnType<typeof createObserver>
>();

export const IsActiveListenerProvider = <T>({
  initialValue,
  children,
}: {
  initialValue: T;
  children: ReactNode;
}) => {
  const [observer] = useState(() =>
    createObserver<T>({ initialState: initialValue })
  );

  return (
    <IsActiveListenerContext.Provider value={observer}>
      {children}
    </IsActiveListenerContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

Now we can have:

```tsx
function Page() {
  return (
    <IsActiveListenerProvider initialValue={false}>
      <Emisor />
      {/* more code */}
      <Listener />
    </IsActiveListenerProvider>
  );
}
```

For the Emisor component:

```tsx
function Emisor() {
  const notify = useNotify(IsActiveListenerContext);
  const handleClick = () => {
    notify((prev) => !prev);
  };
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me to Toggle</button>;
}
```

And for the Listener component:

```tsx
function Listener() {
  const isActive = useSubscribe(IsActiveListenerContext, (state) => state);
  return <div>{isActive && 'Hello, I am active'}</div>;
}
```

Now it will work. Some additional considerations: I may need a smarter way to
create contexts—a context factory that creates contexts when needed so I can
choose my listeners by key from a map. And why would I do that? Because
microfrontends :v. I'm looking for a global way to communicate events
throughout my app, and yes, I need a more agnostic store. I think that
createObserver is more than enough. You can subscribe to it with a useEffect
or any other method you can imagine, and by using the picker, you can extract
only what you want from a big object (even though microfrontends say the API
between your UI components should be minimal and clean).

I'm also looking for a way so that when subscribing, you can tell the
observer, "Hey, when emitting, just do it for these listeners and not the
others." I'm thinking of something like this (heads up: a lot of any types , here, this was a last minute idea):

```tsx
const createObserver = <T>({ initialState }: { initialState: T }) => {
  let state = initialState;
  const listeners = new Set<any>();

  const resolveDispatch = ({
    dispatch,
    predicate,
  }: {
    dispatch: () => void;
    predicate?: (state: T, meta?: any) => boolean;
  }) => {
    if (!predicate) return dispatch();
    if (predicate(state)) dispatch();
  };

  const dispatch = (predicate?: (state: T, meta?: any) => boolean) => {
    if (!predicate) {
      listeners.forEach((listener) => resolveDispatch(listener));
    } else {
      listeners.forEach(
        ({
          dispatch,
          meta,
          predicate: innerPredicate,
        }: {
          dispatch: () => void;
          meta?: any;
          predicate?: (state: T, meta?: any) => boolean;
        }) => {
          if (predicate(state, meta)) {
            resolveDispatch({ dispatch, predicate: innerPredicate });
          }
        }
      );
    }
  };

  return {
    getState: (pickerFn?: (state: T) => any) =>
      pickerFn ? pickerFn(state) : state,
    setState: (
      newStateOrSetter: T | ((prevState: T) => T),
      predicate?: (state: T, meta?: any) => boolean
    ) => {
      if (typeof newStateOrSetter === 'function')
        state = newStateOrSetter(state);
      else state = newStateOrSetter;

      dispatch(predicate);
    },
    subscribe: (listener: any) => {
      listeners.add(listener);
    },
  };
};
```

And now it's time to check if this actually supports my idea for a
microfrontend with an app shell.

There is a caveat, though: now that I see this, subscribing to events in this
way isn't fully possible. Maybe I need to create a factory here? See you in
another article where I continue to make my brain wrestle and my life harder.
